# country-road

An endless road through open country, traced through a procedural landscape
and drawn as a cel-shaded picture. Built in Three.js, no engine.

| key | |
|---|---|
| `W A S D` | drive — and taking the controls switches autodrive off |
| `SPACE` | handbrake |
| `T` | back onto the road, if you have ended up somewhere you cannot leave |
| `F` | autodrive — manual, full, auto steering, auto speed |
| `[` `]` | wind the clock — a tap is half a game-hour, holding keeps going |
| `Z` | rest until morning, or until the rain or snow is over |
| `C` | camera — chase, chase far, bonnet; the wheel moves the eye |
| `ESC` | quit to the load screen: continue, or a new drive |
| `M` | sound on or off — remembered between visits |
| `H` | hide the HUD |
| `O` / `G` | toggle the ink pass / the colour grade |
| `R` | a new seed |
| `N` | on the load screen, with a saved drive: start a fresh one |

Everything in that table is on the phone's `☰` panel too, except `O`, `G`
and `R` — the two render toggles and the reseed, all three of which the load
screen or a query string already reaches.

Mouse: drag to look around, scroll to change the camera distance.

## On a phone

Open it on a phone and the controls change to fit: a thumb pad on the left
that steers by how far you sweep it, a throttle and a brake on the right
(hold the brake at a standstill to reverse), and a strip of buttons in the
top corner — `AUTO`, `CAM`, and `☰` for the other eight commands. Drag
anywhere on the road to look around and pinch to change the camera distance;
the wheel and every key still work if there is one attached.

One control comes and goes: **`stay here`**, high and centre where neither
driving thumb is, for the two seconds a portal crossing lasts. It is the touch
screen's `Esc`, and it is the only way to refuse a gate.

The controls appear when the browser says the pointer is coarse, and on the
first touch regardless. `?touch=1` puts them on a desktop, which is how they
get tested; `?touch=0` takes them away.

`?quality=low` — the default on a touch device — halves the shadow map,
marches the cloud layer at 0.4 of the frame rather than 0.5, and drops the
scene's supersample from 1.75× to 1.25×. `?quality=high` is the desktop
picture, on any device.

`?seed=` takes a word or a number. `?flat` puts the pre-cel renderer back —
standard materials, no post. It only works on the dev server (`npm run dev`);
the production build always draws cel.
`?rec=1` hands the frame loop to a script and skips the load screen.
`?lod=1` pins the ground in the road corridor to 1 m vertex spacing however
far it is from the car — a diagnostic for the ink on the verge, and an
expensive one: it is the case `FAR_LOD` exists to prevent.
`?car=coupe` keeps the code-built stand-in instead of the modelled car.

`?t=18:20`, `?season=autumn`, `?weather=heavyRain` and `?day=7` pin the sky, and
they are useful for screenshots — with a 24-minute day and hourly weather, a
still shot at whatever the seed happened to be doing is not comparable with
anything, including itself an hour later. `?clouds=off` puts the bare gradient
dome back and `?clouds=full` marches the layer at full resolution. `?sky=only`
hides the world so the frame is dome plus cloud layer and nothing else.
`?fresh` ignores the saved drive.

`?signs=off` takes the billboards and their turnings out of the world, which is
how anything that measures the ground gets a before and an after. `?nogo=1`
plays the whole crossing and reports what it *would* have navigated to, so a
gate can be watched firing without the page leaving underneath it. `?start=road`
begins on the main road the way earlier iterations did, `?warpin=0` skips the
arrival, and `?bb=N` adds N synthetic billboards with no image — which is how
"add more entries to the list and it just works" gets tested rather than
asserted.

Every drive starts on a **spring morning** — day 1 of the twelve-day year, at
08:00. The landscape, the weather and the moon are still seeded; only the
calendar is fixed, so a first thirty seconds is the same first thirty seconds.
