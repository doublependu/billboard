# country-road

An endless road through open country, traced through a procedural landscape
and drawn as a cel-shaded picture. Built in Three.js, no engine.

## The game

Stay on the road for as long as you can. The number in the bottom-left corner
is how far you have driven **without stopping** — drop below 10 mph and it goes
back to zero — and **without turning off**: every billboard has a side road
after it with a portal at the end, and driving through one takes you to the
billboard's site and ends the run. Autodrive (`F`) will happily drive for ever.
The question is whether you can leave it alone.

Your best run is kept above the number, across new drives. The billboards come
round in order and start again from the top when the list runs out.


```bash

| key | |
|---|---|
| `W A S D` | drive — and taking the controls switches autodrive off |
| `SPACE` | handbrake |
| `T` | back onto the road, if you have ended up somewhere you cannot leave |
| `F` | autodrive — manual, full, auto steering, auto speed |
| `[` `]` | wind the clock — a tap is half a game-hour, holding keeps going |
| `Z` | rest until morning, or until the rain or snow is over |
| `C` | camera — chase, chase far, bonnet; the wheel moves the eye |
| `ESC` | quit to the load screen: continue, or a new drive |
| `M` | sound on or off — remembered between visits |
| `H` | hide the HUD |
| `O` / `G` | toggle the ink pass / the colour grade |
| `R` | a new seed |
| `N` | on the load screen, with a saved drive: start a fresh one |

Everything in that table is on the phone's `☰` panel too, except `O`, `G`
and `R` — the two render toggles and the reseed, all three of which the load
screen or a query string already reaches.

Mouse: drag to look around, scroll to change the camera distance.

## On a phone

Open it on a phone and the controls change to fit: a thumb pad on the left
that steers by how far you sweep it, a throttle and a brake on the right
(hold the brake at a standstill to reverse), and a strip of buttons in the
top corner — `AUTO`, `CAM`, and `☰` for the other eight commands. Drag
anywhere on the road to look around and pinch to change the camera distance;
the wheel and every key still work if there is one attached.

One control comes and goes: **`stay here`**, high and centre where neither
driving thumb is, for the two seconds a portal crossing lasts. It is the touch
screen's `Esc`, and it is the only way to refuse a gate.

The controls appear when the browser says the pointer is coarse, and on the
first touch regardless. `?touch=1` puts them on a desktop, which is how they
get tested; `?touch=0` takes them away.

`?quality=low` — the default on a touch device — halves the shadow map,
marches the cloud layer at 0.4 of the frame rather than 0.5, and drops the
scene's supersample from 1.75× to 1.25×. `?quality=high` is the desktop
picture, on any device.

`?seed=` takes a word or a number. `?flat` puts the pre-cel renderer back —
standard materials, no post. It only works on the dev server (`npm run dev`);
the production build always draws cel.
`?rec=1` hands the frame loop to a script and skips the load screen.
`?lod=1` pins the ground in the road corridor to 1 m vertex spacing however
far it is from the car — a diagnostic for the ink on the verge, and an
expensive one: it is the case `FAR_LOD` exists to prevent.
`?car=coupe` keeps the code-built stand-in instead of the modelled car.
`?auto` starts with full autodrive (`?auto=steer`, `?auto=speed` for the
others) and skips the load screen. A fresh drive still starts parked with the
handbrake on, which only the throttle or brake lets off — add `&start=road`
to have the autopilot drive away by itself.
`?debug=1` puts a few lines top left: the tier and GPU, the screen's density,
the canvas and scene sizes and which route the picture took to the screen,
the frame rate and the governor's level, and whether the ground is keeping
up with the car. It is the thing to screenshot when a device looks wrong.

`?t=18:20`, `?season=autumn`, `?weather=heavyRain` and `?day=7` pin the sky, and
they are useful for screenshots — with a 24-minute day and hourly weather, a
still shot at whatever the seed happened to be doing is not comparable with
anything, including itself an hour later. `?clouds=off` puts the bare gradient
dome back and `?clouds=full` marches the layer at full resolution. `?sky=only`
hides the world so the frame is dome plus cloud layer and nothing else.
`?fresh` ignores the saved drive.

The billboards are a list in `src/road/billboards.js` — a name, a link and a
32:9 picture under `public/billboards/`. `node perf-bench/faces.mjs` makes the
picture for any entry that has none by photographing its link (a real browser,
so WebGL pages work), at most 250 KB each.

`?signs=off` takes the billboards and their turnings out of the world, which is
how anything that measures the ground gets a before and an after. `?nogo=1`
plays the whole crossing and reports what it *would* have navigated to, so a
gate can be watched firing without the page leaving underneath it. `?start=road`
begins on the main road the way earlier iterations did, `?warpin=0` skips the
arrival, and `?bb=N` adds N synthetic billboards with no image — which is how
"add more entries to the list and it just works" gets tested rather than
asserted.

Every drive starts on a **spring morning** — day 1 of the twelve-day year, at
08:00. The landscape, the weather and the moon are still seeded; only the
calendar is fixed, so a first thirty seconds is the same first thirty seconds.

## Playing it from a script

Both need the dev server (`npm run dev`) and Google Chrome.

```bash
node tools/play/autoplay.mjs --minutes 20             # play, and check it all works
node tools/play/autoplay.mjs --realtime --throttle 4 --quality low
node tools/play/film.mjs --survey country,drift,hills # 48 hours of weather per seed
node tools/play/film.mjs --seed country --hours 48 --out /media/DRIVE2/country-road/two-days
node tools/play/check-mp4.mjs <film.mp4>              # does it decode; frames as PNG
```

`autoplay.mjs` plays with the keys a player has: autodrive, the cameras, a
nudge of the wheel, the handbrake, off into a field and `T`, the part-auto
modes, the clock, a rest through the night. Every action is checked, and so
is every few seconds of driving — off the road under the autopilot, stuck,
fallen through the ground, no ground, an exception. A minute of play is a
game-hour. Exits non-zero on any failure.

`film.mjs` records one continuous drive: every frame stepped, encoded to
H.264 in the page by WebCodecs and muxed to MP4 in Node, with an 8x
time-lapse made from the same frames in the same pass. No ffmpeg needed.
About 11 frames a second on an Intel HD 630, so two game-days is two hours.

The probes behind upstream's `prompt_4.md` fixes (`ai/upstream/`) are in `perf-bench/`: `dpr.mjs` (what
reaches the panel on a high-density screen), `void.mjs` (does the ground keep
up on a throttled CPU), `seam.mjs` (holes in the ground, counted),
`far.mjs` (the world a long way from the origin).
