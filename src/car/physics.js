/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * The physics world.
 *
 * One rule holds this file together, and everything else follows from
 * it: **a collider is built from the numbers the mesh was built from.**
 * Never from `terrain.heightAt`, never from a lattice of its own.  The
 * fault this whole iteration is about is a car standing on a surface
 * nobody can see -- the analytic height field, while the eye watched a
 * mesh that had sampled it at 8 m and interpolated between.  A physics
 * engine that samples the ground independently reproduces that exactly,
 * with more machinery and a wasm blob on top.  So the chunk keeps its
 * heights (`ChunkField._takeHeights`) and they come straight through
 * here into a heightfield collider.
 *
 * What has colliders, and how far out:
 *
 *   terrain    every live chunk within `radius`      the ground
 *   guardrail  every furniture batch within reach    *this is the fence*
 *   trees      trunks, close in only                 so off-road has cost
 *
 * The guardrail is the interesting one.  "The car should be able to drive
 * off the road when there's no fence" makes `Furniture`'s placement rule
 * -- rail where the land falls away from the verge -- into a gameplay
 * rule: it is now the thing that decides where the world lets you leave.
