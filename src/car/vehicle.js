/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * The car -- a rigid body on four raycast wheels.
 *
 * This was an arcade kinematic model: a bicycle model for the horizontal
 * and four samples of `terrain.heightAt` for the vertical, with the body
 * eased toward the mean.  It drove well and it had one fatal property --
 * it stood on the *analytic height field* while the player looked at a
 * mesh that had sampled that field at up to 16 m and interpolated between
 * the samples.  Where the two disagreed, and they disagreed by as much as
 * 17.9 m, the car floated or sank, and no amount of suspension tuning was
 * ever going to touch it.
 *
 * So the fix is not "better suspension", it is **one surface**: the wheels
 * raycast against colliders built from the very numbers the ground mesh
 * was built from.  See `physics.js`.  Rapier's vehicle controller then
 * gives what the brief asks for -- a car held up by its wheels, just
 * touching, with suspension travel, airtime and a real answer to what
 * happens when you drive off the road.
 *
 * The public surface is unchanged: `pos`, `yaw`, `pitch`, `roll`, `speed`,
 * `steer`, `wheelSpin`, `surface`, `grip`, `airborne`, `update`, `applyTo`,
 * `placeOn`.  The chase camera, the HUD, the autodrive and the recorder do
 * not know any of this happened.
 *
 * Local frame: **+Z is forward**, which is the car model's own forward, so
 * `applyTo` can hand the body's quaternion straight to the mesh instead of
 * rebuilding it out of three Euler angles.
 *
 * The numbers below are a *target* for the physics rather than a
 * description of it -- a mid-weight road car that pulls a little over
 * 0.65 g from rest and brakes harder than it accelerates.  The body,
 * wheels and suspension are what actually produce the motion; these are
 * the figures they are held to.

 * Suspension: stiff, and damped on Bullet's own rule.
 *
 * It was `stiffness 30, compression 0.82, relaxation 0.88, travel 0.22`,
 * and those damping numbers look exactly like the 0-to-1 fractions damping
 * usually is.  They are not.  Rapier's raycast vehicle is a port of
 * Bullet's, and Bullet documents its damping coefficient as
 * `2 * sqrt(stiffness) * ratio` with the ratio between 0.1 and 0.3 -- for
 * stiffness 30 that is 1.1 to 3.3, so 0.82 was a damping ratio of 0.075.
 *
 * Measured, by dropping the car 0.8 m onto flat ground: 3 Hz, damping
 * ratio 0.15, three visible oscillations, 1.5 s to settle -- and it was
 * being re-excited continuously by a 1 m collider lattice at 27 m/s.  That
 * is the whole of "the suspension is too bumpy".
 *
 * Now: stiffer, damped at the top of Bullet's range, and with a third less
 * travel, so there is less body movement to damp in the first place.
 * Measured on the same drop: bounces 4 -> 2, settling 1.58 s -> 0.8 s, and
 * at cruise on tarmac the body's pitch settles from 0.38 deg RMS to 0.16.
 *
 * **Do not push the damping past Bullet's range.**  The first attempt at
 * this went to ratios of 0.38 and 0.55 on the reasoning that the brief
 * asks for a car which ignores the road rather than one which follows it.
 * The car then would not move at all: measured suspension load at rest
 * fell to *zero* on all four wheels, and a wheel carrying no load can put
 * down no force, so full throttle produced nothing.  It looked like a
 * drivetrain bug and it was a damping coefficient two lines away.  The
 * safe band is `2 * sqrt(stiffness) * 0.1..0.3`; the numbers below sit at

     * anything steeper than about one and a half per cent a car left alone
     * rolls away, and `tools/probe/park.mjs` measures
     * exactly that: parked on three seeds for an hour of game time, one
     * rolled 195 m and another 168 m, each losing several metres of height
     * on the way.  It is also where the report's "pops up and down" comes
     * from -- 77 of those frames moved the body more than 2 cm vertically,

     * up and down, and from the driver's seat a slow roll reads as a bob

     * it, so it gets a parking brake: below walking pace, with neither
     * pedal touched, the wheels are locked with the same impulse the
