 * The 3D-to-2D pipeline.
 *
 *   scene  ->  rtScene (colour + depth texture)
 *          ->  look pass   : screen-space line work from the depth buffer,
 *                            then colour grade + linear->sRGB
 *          ->  fxaa pass   : clean up the line work, straight to screen
 *
 * or, when the scene is drawn smaller than the screen (see `setSize`):
 *
 *   scene  ->  rtScene
 *          ->  look pass   : the ink's *strength* only, into alpha
 *          ->  up pass     : upscale to device pixels, ink redrawn sharp
 *                            at that resolution, grade + linear->sRGB
 *
 * Ported from `ref/dp-sakura-crossing` (MIT, same author), retuned for a
 * landscape at 30 m/s rather than a townscape at walking pace.
 *
 * Lines come from a *second difference* of linearised depth.  A first
 * difference smears ink across the road wherever the surface grazes the
 * camera; the second difference is flat across any planar surface however
 * oblique, so it fires only on real silhouettes and real creases.
 *
 * Two things had to change for open country, and both were predicted in
 * `plan_0.md`:
 *
 *  - **Distances.**  The town's 40-98 m ink fade and 420 m sky cutoff are
 *    nothing here; a road runs to the horizon and the fade has to run
 *    with it.
 *
 *  - **The grazing horizon.**  A big field of ground seen almost edge-on
 *    is this pass's worst case: the second difference is small but the
 *    *distance normalisation* divides by a large depth, so noise in the
 *    depth buffer comes back as sparkle across the whole lower frame.  A
 *    slope term, taken from the depth gradient the pass already has,
 *    desensitises exactly where the surface is oblique and leaves the
 *    silhouettes alone.

/* The upscale, for a scene drawn smaller than the screen.
 *
 * `prompt_4.md`: "on my phone and on my old Surface Go, the rendering can
 * get quite blurry".  It was, by construction.  The canvas was sized in
 * CSS pixels on every device, so a DPR-3 phone had its picture stretched
 * three times by the compositor -- bilinear, and after FXAA had already
 * softened it once -- and with the governor at its floor the scene was a
 * fifth of the panel.  The canvas is now the size of the panel (see
 * `outFor`), and this pass is what fills it from a scene that is not.
 *
 * Two different upscales, because the picture is two different things:
 *
 *  - **The colour** is bilinear with its weights pulled toward the
 *    nearest texel by `uCrisp`.  Fully that way, each scene texel is a
 *    flat square with a one-pixel ramp at its edge (the "sharp bilinear"
 *    of pixel-art scalers); fully the other, plain bilinear.  A cel
 *    picture is mostly flat fills, so it stands a good deal of this
 *    before it starts to look like a mosaic.
 *
 *  - **The ink** is redrawn.  The look pass leaves how much ink each
 *    scene texel gets in alpha.  Reconstructed with a cubic B-spline,
 *    that is a smooth field whose half-height contour is where the line's
 *    edge belongs, and a smoothstep one *device* pixel wide across that
 *    contour puts a hard edge exactly there.  So a line keeps its width
 *    and its curve and loses the ramp -- which on a phone was two and a
 *    half device pixels of grey either side of every line in the frame.
 *    The contour is taken of the field divided by its local peak, so a
 *    line that is faint because it is far away, or at night, or concave,
 *    is still faint, and only its edge is sharpened.
 *
 *    B-spline and not bilinear, and this was seen before it was reasoned
 *    about: the edge field is close to binary per texel, so a diagonal
 *    line in it is a staircase, and the contour of a *bilinear* staircase
 *    is a staircase with sharp corners -- at the Surface Go's governor
 *    floor, steps two and a half device pixels tall along every ridge.
 *    The spline rounds them off.  Its weights are chosen so the
 *    half-height contour of a two-texel line falls exactly on the line's
 *    two edges, and a one-texel line comes out about nine tenths as wide.
 *
 * Four point taps for the colour and four filtered taps for the spline
 * (the GPU Gems 2 construction: sixteen texels, four bilinear reads).  No
 * FXAA in this route: its job was the ink's stair-steps, and the ink is
 * now drawn at a resolution that has none. */

 * Through space and time.
 *
 * One pass, off for the whole of every drive except the second and a bit

 *
 * Four things happen at once, and the order they arrive in is what makes
 * it read as travel rather than as a screen effect:
 *
 *   1  a **radial smear** from the gate's position on screen, growing
 *      with `uT`.  Sixteen taps along the vector away from the centre,
 *      which is the oldest trick in the book and still the one that says
 *      "moving very fast" more clearly than anything else.
 *   2  **chromatic separation** that grows with radius, so the smear
 *      fringes into colour at the edges of the frame and stays clean
 *      where the player is looking.
 *   3  **starfield streaks** faded in over the second half, drawn in the
 *      same polar frame, which is what turns a fast road into somewhere
 *      that is not a road.
 *   4  a **white-out** at the very end, under which the navigation
 *      happens -- so the page that arrives does so behind a white frame
 *      rather than behind a picture of a hillside.
 *
 * `uT` runs 0..1 and nothing in here reads a clock, so the whole
 * animation is reproducible frame by frame from a probe.
 *
 * **It runs after the look pass, not before the grade.**  Upstream of
 * this repository the ink and the grade were two passes and the warp went
 * between them; here they are one, and the warp goes after it -- so the
 * frame it smears is line work and all, which is the half of that
 * argument worth keeping (ink drawn *on top* of a warp is a pencil
 * drawing of a blur).  What it costs is that the maths happens in sRGB
 * rather than in linear light, which for a smear, a fringe and a fade to
 * white is a difference nobody can name.
