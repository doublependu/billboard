 * How hard to work the GPU, and how to find out.
 *
 * Three tiers, and the middle one is the one this file exists for: a
 * laptop or a desktop drawing on the graphics built into its CPU.  Before
 * it there were two, `high` for anything with a mouse and `low` for
 * anything with a finger, and an Intel HD 630 at 1920x1080 counted as
 * `high` -- which drew the scene at 2849x1473, sampled every ground
 * texture at 16x anisotropic, and ran at **7.7 frames a second**.
 *
 * Measured on that machine, one change at a time, frames per second:
 *
 *     as shipped                                    7.7
 *     scene at 1x rather than 1.42x, 2x aniso      19.9
 *     ... and the cloud march at 1/4, history 1/2  22.5
 *     ... and nothing else drawn at all            33.9
 *
 * That last row is what found `FAR_LOD` in `chunks.js`: with the clouds,
 * the shadows and the post all switched off, a frame still cost 30 ms,
 * and most of it was a kilometre of 1 m ground drawn as sub-pixel
 * triangles.
 *
 * The tier picks a *starting point*.  `ResolutionGovernor` below then
 * watches the frame rate and moves the render scale, because a GPU name
 * is a guess about the machine and a frame time is a measurement of it.
