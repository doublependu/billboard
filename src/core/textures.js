/* ------------------------- Worley, and why -------------------------- *
 *
 * Value-noise fBm erodes a cloud into *smoke*.  Every reference in
 * `ref/cloud/` is made of rounded lumps with sharp gaps between them, and
 * a sum of smoothed lattices has neither: its level sets are blobby in the
 * middle and blobby at the edge, so subtracting it from a silhouette
 * thins the cloud evenly and reads as fog with a shape.
 *
 * Worley (cellular) noise is the standard answer and has been since
 * Schneider's Horizon cloud talk -- `~/Repos/others/three-geospatial`
 * builds exactly this pair of volumes in `cloudShape.frag` and
 * `cloudShapeDetail.frag`, and its clouds billow where ours smear.  What
 * makes it work is that **inverted** Worley (`1 - d^2` to the nearest
 * feature point) is a field of round bumps that meet at creases: erode
 * with it and you carve *cauliflower*, because the level sets themselves
 * are spherical.
 *
 * Both volumes are built on the CPU at boot rather than in a render
 * target, because everything else in this project's noise is (`fbmField`,
 * `fbmVolume`) and because the probes read the same arrays the GPU does.
 * Cost is measured in `CloudField`'s constructor and printed under
 * `?debug`.
