/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * The controls a phone has.
 *
 * Everything in this game was reachable from a keyboard and nothing else:
 * W A S D to drive, eleven single keys for the commands, a wheel for the
 * camera distance.  On a phone that is a beautiful landscape you can look
 * at and a car you cannot move -- which is the same class of bug as every
 * other one in this project's history, a control that is not there being
 * indistinguishable from a control that is broken.
 *
 * Three things go in, and they map onto the three things the keyboard
 * already did:
 *
 *   the pad    a relative thumbstick on the bottom left.  Analog steering,
 *              which is the one axis where a phone can be *better* than a
 *              keyboard: `Input` has to ease a key into a steering angle
 *              because a key is a step function, and a thumb is not.
 *   the pedals bottom right, throttle over brake.  Binary, exactly like
 *              W and S -- holding the brake at a standstill still reverses,
 *              because that is `Vehicle`'s rule and not the keyboard's.
 *   the strip  top right: the two commands you reach for while driving
 *              (autodrive, camera) and a panel behind `☰` for the nine
 *              that you do not.
 *
 * **Nothing here touches the game.**  The pad and the pedals write into
 * `input.touch`, which `Input.sample` folds in beside the keyboard and the
 * gamepad; the buttons call the same `command()` that a keypress calls.
 * So the autopilot's per-channel override, the takeover latch, the toasts
 * and the save all work on a phone without knowing a phone exists.  That
 * is the whole point of `input.js`'s opening line -- input is data, not
 * events -- finally being cashed in.
 *
 * Looking around and the camera distance are *not* here.  They belong to
 * `core/pointer.js`, which has always used pointer events, so a finger
 * already dragged the view for free; what it gained for this is the
 * second finger, because a phone has no scroll wheel and a pinch is the
 * gesture everybody already knows.
 *
 * ## When the controls appear
 *
 * `(pointer: coarse) and (hover: none)` is the phone-or-tablet test, and
 * it is checked at boot -- but it is not the only way in.  A false
 * negative here is fatal (no controls at all, on the one device that has
 * no keyboard either), so a first `touchstart` anywhere also enables them.
 * A false positive is merely untidy, and the touchscreen laptop that
 * reports coarse-and-hover-none is rare enough to accept.  `?touch=1` and
 * `?touch=0` force it either way, which is how this gets tested on a
 * desktop at all.

   * Zoom: a control this game does not have, and which iOS hands out
   * anyway.
   *
   * `user-scalable=no` in the viewport meta has been ignored by Safari
   * since iOS 10 -- page zoom is an accessibility guarantee, and for a
   * document that is the right call.  So a second tap on the throttle
   * zooms the page *into* the throttle, and every tap after that lands
   * somewhere the control no longer is.  Neither `touch-action: none` nor
   * the `preventDefault` on `pointerdown` in `_pedal` stops it: WebKit
   * builds pointer events on top of touch events and does not let the
   * pointer one cancel the touch default.  Only a `preventDefault` on the
   * *touch* event does.
   *
   * Two of those, then:
   *
   *   - every touch that ends on a control, unconditionally.  Nothing in
   *     here waits for a `click` -- the buttons all fire on
   *     `pointerdown` -- so there is no default left worth keeping.
   *   - anywhere else, only the second of a quick pair.  A single tap on
   *     the canvas keeps whatever the browser wanted to do with it; it is
   *     the double tap, and only the double tap, that zooms.
   *
   * And the way back out.  Cancelling `gesturestart` is what stops a
   * two-finger pinch scaling the page out from under the pinch that is
   * meant to be moving the camera -- but unconditionally it also cancels
   * the *only* gesture that undoes a zoom already in progress, which is
   * how a double tap became a trap with no way back.  So it stands down
   * whenever the page is actually scaled: while it is, a pinch belongs to
   * Safari and the player can get back to 1x.
