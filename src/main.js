 * well would be a second, invisible one.  So `frame()` gates on `paused`
 * and runs neither `tick` nor `draw`.
 *
 * **"Continue" means the drive that is running**, not the drive in the
 * cookie.  A reload would cost four seconds and land at whatever arc
 * position the save last wrote -- and the save is throttled to one write
 * every two seconds.  A pause menu that loses two seconds of your drive is
 * a bug, so continue is one line: unpause.  "New drive, fresh start" is
 * still `freshStart()` and still reloads, because a new world genuinely is
 * a new page.
 *
 * **The save goes first**, so a player who quits the tab from the menu
 * loses nothing.

  /**
   * The rendered frame, as a PNG data URL, read straight off the canvas.
   *
   * `Page.captureScreenshot` grabs the *compositor's* surface, and the
   * compositor runs on its own schedule -- so a frame drawn by `step()`
   * and then captured could come back as whatever had last been
   * composited, which in practice meant stills of a scene from several
   * seconds and one teleport ago.  Three separate "rendering bugs" in two
   * rounds of captured stills were this and nothing else.  Reading the
   * canvas is exact, and it is only possible at all because recording mode
   * asks for `preserveDrawingBuffer`.
   *
   * The `finish()` is not defensive; without it about one frame in two
   * hundred came back **entirely black**, and the films flickered.
   * `toDataURL` snapshots the drawing buffer, and the draw above has only
   * been *issued* -- the commands are still in flight on the GPU when the
   * snapshot is taken, and losing that race gives a cleared buffer rather
   * than a stale one, which is why it is black rather than a frame late.
   * It is a race, so it went unseen: 800 captured frames without the sync
   * gave five black, with it none, and one bad frame per seven seconds of
   * film is invisible in a still and impossible to miss in a film.
   *
   * `finish()` is the sledgehammer of GL synchronisation and here that is
   * exactly right -- this path is never on a player's frame budget, and
   * the alternative (a fence, polled) buys nothing when the very next
   * thing we do is block on a PNG encode anyway.
   *
   * It is not quite the whole cure -- one frame in a few thousand still
   * came back black with the sync in -- so the snapshot is *checked*, and
   * a cleared buffer is drawn again rather than handed back.  Four
   * corners, because a cleared buffer is zero everywhere and a rendered
   * frame is not: even the moonlit shots have a sky above the horizon.  A
   * real frame that does read zero at all four costs a redraw and is then
   * returned anyway, so the test is allowed to be wrong in that
   * direction and not in the other.
   *
   * A redraw is not quite free of consequence: `draw` advances the cloud
   * march, which is progressive, so a film that had to retry a frame
   * differs from one that did not by a fraction of a cloud march on that
   * frame.  That is the price of the frame not being black, and it is
   * worth paying -- but it is why the recorder counts retries and says so
   * rather than swallowing them.
