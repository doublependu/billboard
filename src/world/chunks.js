 * where the resolution comes from: **distance to the road's midline, and
 * distance to the car, whichever is finer**.
 *
 * The midline half came first, and it was right on its own
 * for as long as the camera was always *on* the road: lateral offset from
 * the midline is a stable proxy for how much of the screen a chunk will
 * ever occupy, and unlike camera distance it does not change as you drive,
 * so a chunk could be built once and never revisited.  Both halves of that
 * stopped being true in the same iteration -- the car can leave the road
 * now, and the tracer can delete road it has already laid -- so chunks are
 * rebuildable, and `_relod` decides when.
 *
 * The loaded set is an ellipse pointing up the road rather than a circle
 * around the car, because at 30 m/s the budget belongs on land about to
 * be seen and not on land already passed.
 *
 * Nothing allocates in the steady state: geometries are pooled by
 * resolution and rewritten in place, and the build is a generator the
 * frame loop drains against a millisecond budget.

 *
 * So resolution is now the finer of the two bands.  The car ring is
 * tighter than the road corridor because it follows a point rather than a

 * -- 63 chunks and 2.06 million of the frame's 2.2 million triangles on
 * `?seed=country`, most of them a kilometre or more down the road, where a
 * 1 m triangle is a fraction of a pixel.  Sub-pixel triangles are the

 * the road in it must not be built so coarse that the carriageway falls
 * between two vertices -- so the cap stops at 4 m, which keeps two
 * vertices across the tarmac.  Chunks refine as the car approaches, and
 * the extra builds are cheap: a chunk is built at 4, 2 and then 1 m, and
 * the two coarse builds together cost 5/16 of the fine one.

   * baked.  Two things now change it.  The car's own band moves with the

   * the tracer *deletes nodes it has already laid* when a watchdog trips --
   * up to 2.7 km of them.  A chunk baked over ground the road has since
   * left holds a benched carriageway through an empty field, and the ground
   * where the road actually went is unbenched.
   *
   * Finer is applied at once, because it is a correctness fault: the road
   * or the car is there *now*.  Coarser hangs back by a quarter of the band
   * (`_carLod(.., 0.8)`), so a chunk sitting on a boundary does not
   * oscillate between two resolutions as the car idles across it.  Drawing
   * something finer than it needs to be costs frame time; drawing it
   * coarser than it needs to be costs the player a hole in the world.
   *
   * The road-distance half of the test is on a rolling cursor rather than
   * every chunk every frame: `roughDistance` rings outward from the query
   * cell and a chunk far from the road pays for the whole disc, so 400 of
   * them five times over is not a frame budget, it is the frame.  A slice
   * of 24 revisits the whole field about three times a second, which is

         * offset paints a tongue of tarmac off the end of the road, which
