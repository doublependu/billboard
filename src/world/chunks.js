 * A square grid in world XZ, and the thing worth knowing about it is
 * where the resolution comes from: **distance to the road's midline, and
 * distance to the car, whichever is finer**.
 *
 * The midline half came first, and it was right on its own
 * for as long as the camera was always *on* the road: lateral offset from
 * the midline is a stable proxy for how much of the screen a chunk will
 * ever occupy, and unlike camera distance it does not change as you drive,
 * so a chunk could be built once and never revisited.  Both halves of that
 * stopped being true in the same iteration -- the car can leave the road
 * now, and the tracer can delete road it has already laid -- so chunks are
 * rebuildable, and `_relod` decides when.
 *
 * The loaded set is an ellipse pointing up the road rather than a circle
 * around the car, because at 30 m/s the budget belongs on land about to
 * be seen and not on land already passed.
 *
 * Nothing allocates in the steady state: geometries are pooled by
 * resolution and rewritten in place, and the build is a generator the
 * frame loop drains against a millisecond budget.

 * spacing, which is a low-poly ramp to look at and, far worse, to drive
 * on, because the collider is built from these same heights.
 *
 * So resolution is now the finer of the two bands.  The car ring is
 * tighter than the road corridor because it follows a point rather than a

 * -- 63 chunks and 2.06 million of the frame's 2.2 million triangles on
 * `?seed=country`, most of them a kilometre or more down the road, where a
 * 1 m triangle is a fraction of a pixel.  Sub-pixel triangles are the
 * worst case a GPU has: every one of them shades a full 2x2 block for the
 * derivatives, so the ground's fifteen-tap texture body ran several times
 * per pixel of distant hillside, each tap at 16x anisotropic.  Measured on
 * an Intel HD 630 with the 1 m chunks hidden, the scene pass went from 42
 * to 15 ms.
 *
 * The corridor half of the header's argument still holds -- a chunk with
 * the road in it must not be built so coarse that the carriageway falls
 * between two vertices -- so the cap stops at 4 m, which keeps two
 * vertices across the tarmac.  Chunks refine as the car approaches, and
 * the extra builds are cheap: a chunk is built at 4, 2 and then 1 m, and
 * the two coarse builds together cost 5/16 of the fine one.
 *
