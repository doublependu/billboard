 * What grows on it.
 *
 * Trees are the single most visible system in the frame -- more than the
 * terrain, more than the road -- so this file gets more care than its
 * size suggests.  They are cross-planed cards rather than geometry, which
 * is what most real-time landscapes do: fifteen hundred trees of real
 * branches is not affordable and does not look better at 200 m.
 *
 * Placement is a pure function of the chunk index, so a chunk thrown away
 * behind the car and rebuilt in front of it grows the same wood back.
 *
 * Density comes from a slow noise -- woods, not a uniform sprinkle.  An
 * even scatter of trees at constant spacing is the most reliable way to
 * make a landscape look procedural, and clumping is most of the fix.
