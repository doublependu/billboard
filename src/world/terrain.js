 * whole of `gap` once we are clear, and a parabola in between.  Without it
 * the earthwork meets the hillside along a mathematically exact crease,
 * which reads as a fold in paper rather than as ground -- and which the
 * ink pass draws, because a crease is exactly what it looks for.
 *
 * **This replaces a rounding that had two faults and drew three lines.**
 * What was here was `0.5 * min(gap, ROUNDING * min(1, over / 6))`:
 *
 *  - It was keyed on `over` as well as `gap`, and the `over` ramp is a
 *    slope of 0.25 that switches on at the platform edge and off six
 *    metres later.  That is two slope breaks of a quarter -- one of them
 *    exactly on top of the hinge, where it cancelled the fillet `batter()`
 *    had just put there, and one six metres out in the grass, which is the
 *    line still running along the verge after the first two creases were
 *    dealt with.  Measured on the cross-section at s = 10520: breaks of
 *    0.15 at the hinge and 0.17 at over = 6, against 0.028 for the
 *    fillet's own curvature.
 *  - And `min(gap, 3) * 0.5` is nonzero for *every* gap, so it lifted the
 *    whole cut face by up to a metre and a half rather than easing its
 *    crest.  The batter was never the batter it said it was.
 *
 * The parabola below is C1 at both ends by construction and touches
 * neither fault: it is exactly zero once the face is `k` below natural
 * ground, exactly `gap` once it is `k` above, and its curvature in ground
 * terms is `m^2 / (2k)` where `m` is how fast the two surfaces are
 * closing -- about 0.06 per metre against a cut face on gentle ground,
 * which is under the knee the ink starts drawing at.  The cost is that
 * the crest is rounded off by `k / 4`, half a metre, which is what a
 * rounded crest is.
 *
 * **`k` still has to grow from nothing at the platform edge**, and that is
 * the one thing the old `over` ramp was right about.  A blend of scale `k`
 * pulls the surface `k / 4` off natural ground wherever the two are within
 * `k` of each other -- *including where they are merely close and never
 * cross* -- and the cut branch pulls it down while the fill branch pulls
 * it up.  At the platform edge, where the batter has no height yet and
 * which branch we are in is decided by a coin toss between `h` and `edge`,
 * that is a step of `k / 2` running the length of the road: breaks of 0.8
 * at s = 2500, worse than the crease it replaced.
 *
 * So `k` is ramped over twice the hinge, which keeps it under the batter's
 * own height everywhere -- `k <= batter(over)` for both slopes, checked
 * along the whole ramp -- and therefore keeps the branch change inside the
 * region where both branches return natural ground.  A smoothstep and not
 * a line, because the ramp's own slope lands in the answer at a quarter of
 * its value, and `0.25 / 4` is exactly the crease the old one drew.
 */
/**
 * **And the two faults that were left in it, which are `prompt_3.md` item
 * 2.**  `ai/perf-bench/verge.mjs` with `SECTION=2500` is the evidence:
 * every crease this file has worked on is under 0.07 per metre there and
 * there is a single spike of **0.206 at nine metres from the midline**,
 * which is the daylight line and which is the dark line running along the
 * verge in `ref/prompt_3_1.png`.
 *
 * *One.*  `k` was a height written down as a constant, and the parabola's
 * curvature in ground terms is `m^2 / 2k` where `m` is how fast the two
 * surfaces are closing per metre out.  A constant `k` is therefore a blend
 * whose curvature is whatever the hillside happens to be doing.
 *
 * *Two, and it is the one that draws.*  `k` was ramped by `smoothstep01(
 * over / (2 * HINGE))` to keep it under the batter's own height -- and on
 * a **shallow** earthwork, which is most of the road, the daylight line
 * arrives while that ramp is still near zero.  At s = 2500 the earthwork
 * is 16 cm deep, it daylights two metres past the platform edge, and `k`
 * there is 0.15 against a gap that closes at 0.14 per metre: the surface
 * steps off the batter onto the hillside in half a metre of ground.  The
 * rounding was in the code and not in the ground.
 *
 * `daylight()` below solves for the `k` that puts the curvature at
 * `DAYLIGHT_K` instead of writing a height down, so the blend is a fixed
 * width **in ground** and a shallow daylight line gets a small blend
 * rather than none.  At s = 2500 that is `k` = 0.09 and a curvature of
 * 0.11, and the 0.206 spike is gone.
 *
 * And the ramp goes with it, because `heightAt` no longer needs one -- see
 * the note on branches there.  `FILL_ROUND` goes too: it widened the blend
 * at a toe because `m` there is the fill slope *plus* the hillside's where
 * in a cutting it is the cut slope *minus* it, and a `k` derived from `m`
 * is already wider at a toe by exactly that factor.

 * lands wherever arithmetic puts it, which is how a still came out with

 *
 * **And the sentinel is not enough on its own.**  It is *signed* -- a

 * way to the horizon.
 *
 * **The fall**, and this is the half that had to be rewritten.  The
 * carriageway sits 16 cm above the verge beside it, and that drop used to
 * be spent over the last 95 cm of tarmac: a quadratic reaching a slope of
 * 0.35 at `CARRIAGEWAY` and then flat.  A slope break is a step in the
 * first difference of depth, which is precisely what the ink in
 * `core/post.js` fires on -- and because the ground is a *lattice*, a
 * crease reaches the screen as one small crease per vertex row, so it drew
 * not as a line but as a broken band of dashes following the road the
 * whole way to the horizon.  That is the first half of `prompt_2.md`.
 *
 * What the ink actually cares about is **curvature**, not slope
 * continuity: the second difference is the curvature times the square of
 * the tap's footprint, and on a 1 m lattice it is the slope break per
 * vertex row, which is the curvature times a metre.  Merely landing the

 * the verge score in `ai/plan_2.md` s2); spending the same drop over more
 * ground is worth all of it.
 *
 * So the fall now runs from 0.78 of the carriageway out to **the platform
 * edge**, as a smoothstep: about 3.2 to 4.2 m of ground rather than 0.95,
 * which is a peak curvature of 0.08 per metre against the knee at about
 * 0.2.  Ending it at `w` rather than at a constant is what keeps it in
 * step with `platform()` -- the fall finishes exactly where the batter
 * begins, both with zero slope, so there is no second crease where they
 * meet and no second number to keep in agreement.
 *
 * The tarmac is flatter for it: the drop at the white line is about 3 cm

     * beats any radius, and every vertex in the world pays for the search.

     * nothing left to step.  Smoothstep rather than a ramp, so the join has
     * no crease of its own for the same pass to find.
